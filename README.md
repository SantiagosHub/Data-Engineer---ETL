# Data-Engineer---ETL
Data Logging Exercise
Welcome to the Data Logging Exercise! This exercise is designed to teach participants how to effectively log data transformations, ensuring transparency and traceability in data processing pipelines.

Objective
The main goal of this exercise is to:

Introduce the concept and importance of data logging in data transformation processes.
Provide hands-on experience in implementing logging mechanisms in code.
Troubleshoot common logging-related issues.
Prerequisites
Before starting this exercise, you should be familiar with:

Basic Python programming concepts, including functions, loops, and conditions.
The concept of data transformation and ETL processes.
Instructions
Setup: Clone the repository using the command: git clone https://github.com/SantiagosHub/Data-Engineer---ETL .
Environment Setup: Ensure you've set up a Python environment with all necessary libraries. This can be done using pip install -r requirements.txt inside the project directory.
Run Initial Scripts: Before diving into the main exercise, run the initial setup scripts provided in the scripts directory.
Exercises
1. Basic Logging Implementation

Learn how to integrate a basic logging mechanism into your data transformation code.
Implement a function that logs the start and end of data transformation phases.
2. Advanced Logging Techniques

Dive deeper into logging levels (DEBUG, INFO, WARN, etc.) and their importance.
Implement conditional logging based on log levels.

Troubleshooting
If you encounter issues:

NameError: 'log' not defined: This error means the logging function or module has not been imported or defined in your current code. Make sure to check the order of script execution and whether you've properly integrated the logging module.
For further assistance or to report other issues, please raise an issue on this GitHub repository or contact the exercise administrator.
